# Live-Eye--Large-Scale-Object-Recognition
This project uses deep machine learning to perform object recognition at large scale.

We will be using state of the art deep machine learning tools and technologies to perform object recognition on more than 2,00,000 images.
The dataset used here is from imagenet and Microsoft COCO hallenge 2015.
